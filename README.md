# Exploratory Data Analysis & Simple Recommendation Tool

## Introduction
This repository explores the King County Housing Dataset (years 2014 and 2015). You can find the EDA in the jupyter notebook **EDA.ipynb**.

I've also build a simple recommendation tool that filters data according to user input. It is build with streamlit and can be found in the **app** folder.
